TO AID IN NAVIGATION, THIS FILE WILL HAVE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN EACH ASPECT OF THE PROJECT.

=============================
1. HOW TO RUN THE MICROSERVICES:

A) GO TO EACH MICROSERVICE ROOT FOLDER AND BUILD THE DOCKERFILE
B) NAVIGATE TO /microservices FOLDER
B) RUN start-kafka.bash IN GIT BASH (CREATES KAFKA CLUSTER AND DATABASE)
C) RUN topic-creation.bash IN ANOTHER GIT BASH INSTANCE (CREATES TOPICS)
D) RUN docker compose -p assessment-prod -f compose-prod.yml up -d

==============================
2. HOW TO RUN THE VARIOUS COMMAND LINE INTERFACES:

MY PROJECT USES ONE CLI PER MICROSERVICE, SO NAVIGATE TO THE
CLI ROOT FOLDER, AND RUN GRADLE WITH THE APPROPRIATE COMMANDS.
USE THE -H ARGUMENT TO SEE THE COMMANDS AVAILABLE.
